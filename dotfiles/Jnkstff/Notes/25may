######   May 25th ####

Today is the begining of my daily journal and todo list what not. 

1. Make a proper to do list that I can keep track of easily
1. Research how to make my programs deploy haow and where I want at startup 



###  So I broke my bash today.  I commented out the file pointer and Bash
could not find any commands.  Took me a little while, and a few searches,
before I was able to figure it out.  Moral of the paragraph, don't delete
you path files.  


9:30   OK I got my alacrity yaml or config file in shape.  there isn't much on there yet but its a start for sure 

I also started with my tmux configuration file but yat is still proving hard for me to make work 

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/adn/.local/bin/bottle.py", line 3765, in <module>
    run(args[0], host=host, port=int(port), server=opt.server,

    app = load_app(app)
  File "/home/adn/.local/bin/bottle.py", line 3052, in load_app
    rv = load(target) # Import the target module
  File "/home/adn/.local/bin/bottle.py", line 3037, in load
    if module not in sys.modules: __import__(module)
